# ChemLab1
Please change naming of each lab jsp to labX_Y.jsp where X is the section (0 for chem1 
and 1 for chem2) and Y is the number of the lab. This is mostly to test commit, etc.
# update
Changed to 0, and 1 (rather than 1 and 2) makes a bit more sense, i've made all the 
changes to file names rather than changing code.
# error report
Lab 3 still need chemical formula input schema from Mahmudul
Lab 7 has an error in the jsp, final row should be only present in 1 column (this is an 
average of the 3 samples)
Lab 7 also missing unit column included with correct answers in spreadsheet from 
foster, is this missing, or an intented exclusion?
Lab 8 also seems to be missing a units column.
Lab 9 still need chemical formula input schema from Mahmudul
